# Migration of Applications from Azure to Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
## Overview:
This project involves migrating applications, virtual machines, and associated resources from Microsoft Azure to Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The migration aims to enhance performance, reduce costs, and leverage GCPâ€™s advanced capabilities, including better data analytics, machine learning, and improved infrastructure.

## Key Phases in the Migration Process:
**Onboard**: Select and prepare the source VM for migration.

**Replication**: Replicate data from Azure to GCP continuously.

**Set VM Target Details**: Configure the VM settings on GCP (instance type, network, etc.).

**Test-Clone**: Optionally, create a clone of the VM for testing purposes on GCP.

**Cut-Over**: Migrate the source VM to GCP by stopping the source VM, completing a final replication, and creating a production instance on GCP.

**Finalize**: Perform final cleanup after successful migration.
